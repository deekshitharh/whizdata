                  We provide well-designed solutions that can breathe automation
                  & optimization into your work-flow. <br /> Embrace best
                  practice adoption as a foundational attribute. Our experience
                  in design automation, test automation and model engineering
                  brings in some of the best systems into practice at Whizdata.
                  Our technical leaders have multiple patents in design
                  engineering automation. Most of our API framework, test
                  infrastructure, unit and API level tests etc. are
                  auto-generated out of our own home-grown design tools. This
                  not only cuts the design and test cost / time, but also
                  guarantees uniformity in coding and reduces human induced
                  errors. <br /> If we need a change in the design, most likely
                  all we have to change is our own specification files. The rest
                  of the design-flow adheres to the new requirement
                  automatically! This reduces turn-around time for bug closures
                  and helps us to manage ECOs more efficiently. Test, learn and
                  share with other technical and business experts We have
                  experience working at the extreme ends of tech-savvy users. On
                  one side, we have enabled high-tech engineering teams to
                  automate their design flow, and the components of our solution
                  are parsers, code-generators, optimizers and report
                  generators. <br /> On the other end of our customer profile
                  are people who are experts in a domain on their own, but are
                  not expert users of computer in any form factor. This
                  background gives us a wide array of skills spanning from UX
                  design to API engineering which makes the promised end-user
                  experience realizable.
